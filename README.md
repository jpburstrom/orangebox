A Lightbox script like OrangeBox is used to set specific content on a web page apart from the rest of your content. Think of it as a showcase for important content such as images, videos, forms, and important information. Traditionally, a lightbox script dims the browser page and brings the specified content to the center of the screen.

OrangeBox is made to be simple. The Javascript is just 16KB but has powerful features. It supports common image file types, QuickTime movies, SWF files, inline content, iFrames, and Vimeo & YouTube video streaming.
